//console.log and debugging
//we can debug with console.log messages in 2 big ways:
//1) we can check the status of some javascript "thing"
//2) we can check a process we have built with repeated console.log messages

//example 1:
var sample = "John";
console.log(sample);

//example 2:
var num = 1;
console.log(num);
num++
console.log(num);
num++
console.log(num);
